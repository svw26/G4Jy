# G4Jy

This is a repository for things related to the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample, with G4Jy names (https://cds.unistra.fr/cgi-bin/Dic-Simbad?/5974354) being fully-resolvable in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database! :tada: 

This sample is a compilation of the brightest radio-sources across the southern sky (Dec. < 30 deg), which have an integrated flux-density > 4 Jy at 151 MHz (as measured in the GLEAM extragalactic catalogue, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08318). The vast majority of these sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN) with powerful radio-jets, although the sample is also known to contain two nearby, star-forming galaxies, a cluster relic, a halo, and the Flame Nebula. The Orion Nebula is excluded for the GLEAM catalogue, and thus the G4Jy Sample, but we provide new low-frequency flux-density measurements for this object in Appendix A of Paper I.

* For an overview of the sample, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13125
* Paper I details how the sample and catalogue were constructed -- https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13125 -- with supplementary material for Appendix F available here: https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy/tree/master/G4Jy_PaperI_AppendixF
* Paper II provides details of cross-identification for the sample -- https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13025 

:sparkles::sparkles: **As Papers I and II were completed in conjunction with one another, please cite _both_ when referring to the G4Jy Sample (White et al., 2020a, 2020b).** :sparkles::sparkles: 

Furthermore, given the length of these papers, please consider the environment and save trees by not printing... :innocent:

The value-added G4Jy catalogue can be found here: \
https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy/tree/master/catalogue/G4Jy_catalogue_18012020.fits \
and is also available at CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) \
or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?VIII/105 on VizieR. 

## Overlays and cutouts for the G4Jy Sample

Please see the Zenodo repository, https://zenodo.org/communities/g4jy ,
for the following images associated with White et al. (2020a, 2020b), each being per GLEAM component:
* 10-arcmin across overlays
* 1-deg across overlays
* GLEAM cutouts
* TGSS cutouts
* NVSS/SUMSS cutouts

The above cutouts were downloaded via SkyView (https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl), which can also be used to download the WISE images that were used for the two sets of G4Jy overlays.

In addition, the Zenodo repository contains the following images from MeerKAT follow-up of G4Jy sources, described by Sejake et al. (2023; https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12242):
* 10-arcmin across overlays, including MeerKAT contours
* In-band spectral-index maps (at 1.3 GHz) 


## Seminars/colloquia

As an astrophysicist concerned about the climate crisis, I have both hosted and delivered numerous online talks, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint. Please email (sarahwhite.astro@gmail.com) if you would like me to give a talk on the G4Jy Sample for your institution, either remotely or the next time I am in your part of the world. :earth_americas::earth_africa::earth_asia:

Finally, feel free to use the conference poster made available here: \
https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy/tree/master/posters/SarahWhite_G4Jy_portrait_poster.pdf \
(The font size has been chosen so that the poster works equally well for A0 to A4 paper sizes.)
